However, I am having a difficult time leaving without any memories from my successful business. It was not an easy choice, or rather it was not a choice at all. \nMaybe you have seen a story in the news about a guy who got mugged brutally on IKEA’s parking lot by one of those bike gang members that have gone all the way down the country from city to city in recent months. \nAnyways, the guy who was beat up was me, and I was left with a threat to my own life. So I am just about ready to get the shoe horn and leave as fast as possible. I already found a new apartment, and I think you should be able to send the painting to my new address whenever you have time. I’m embarrassed to say that I can’t pay you in kilograms of diamonds, but if you do this job I promise I will commission you again and recommend you to anyone who asks about the artist of the painting. Sort of a mixed payment in exposure I suppose? \nThanks, from Lucas",

Most of the questions are about the burglar however, and I’ve decided to tell him everything. She says we might get to bring this all to court, which could relieve me from being scared for my life as I’m sure you understand. Although, we sort of need a reference of the burglar, and as I’ve only seen him, I can only think of hiring a forensic sketch artist to draw the scary-looking guy. I’m sure that’s not a challenge for you however. He’s just this big bulky ugly scary-looking monster guy. For instance, imagine a fully grown man built like a giant teapot, or a church bell or something. I hope that gives you enough to work your art magic. I need it done quite soon, as the PI hurries for me to get to court before the case goes cold. \nThanks, from Lucas",

Apparently, I’m not the only victim but I did end up being the last victim of his heinous crimes. I had my own lawyer Kimmie, who aggressively tore down the burglar during the trial. I especially remember when she delivered the final statement with a striking accusing pose, and the witnesses had to contain themselves not to burst out cheering.
